          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            {siteName} is privacy-forward. We collect only what we need to operate the Services and
            improve quality. Payments are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong> (Merchant of Record).
          </p>

          <h2>What we collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Account info: email, name (optional).</li>
            <li>Usage logs: timestamps, feature usage, basic analytics.</li>
            <li>
              Business calls: metadata (from/to/duration). Audio and transcripts only where legally permitted
              and with explicit consent, and retained for a limited period for quality and agent training.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What we do <em>not</em> collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>No payment card data (Paddle handles this).</li>
            <li>No camera video is uploaded unless you explicitly opt-in; tutor camera is local-only by default.</li>
            <li>No intentional collection of sensitive identifiers (SSNs, national IDs, etc.).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We keep minimal logs as needed for operations and compliance. Business call recordings/transcripts,
            if enabled, are typically retained 30â€“60 days unless you request deletion sooner.
          </p>

          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Access, update, or delete your data by emailing {contactEmail}.</li>
            <li>Opt-out of call recording at any time; we will proceed without recording.</li>
            <li>Cancel subscriptions anytime from your billing portal.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Disclosures</h2>
          <p>
            We may share limited data with processors necessary to provide the Services (e.g., Paddle for billing,
            cloud hosting, email). We do not sell personal data.
          </p>
